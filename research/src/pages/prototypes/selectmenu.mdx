# Background

The `<select>` element does not provide enough customization for web developers, which leads them to implement their own and likely miss out on the performance, reliability, and accessibility of built-in form control elements. More on that is in the [select proposal](../components/select) and [Custom Control UI](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/ControlUICustomization/explainer.md#introduction).

# How to use the &lt;selectmenu&gt; component

Based on the [select](../components/select) proposal, the implementation of a new `<selectmenu>` control has started in [Chromium](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5737365999976448).
This control is available in Chromium-based browsers by enabling the **Experimental Web Platform features** experiment in about:flags.

## Help test the control

`<selectmenu>` is not ready for production use yet, but we value your feedback if you want to spend some time testing it.

By being an early tester, you can actively help us make the control better for everyone. Read the documentation below to learn how to use the control.

If you encouter bugs or limitations with the design of the control, please send your feedback by [creating issues on the open-ui GitHub repository](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/new?title=[select]%20&labels=select). Here is a list of [open selectmenu bugs in open-ui](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aselect).

## Anatomy of the selectmenu

Because the various parts of the selectmenu can be styled, it's important to understand the anatomy of this UI control.

<SelectAnatomy />

- `<selectmenu>` - The root element that contains the button and listbox.
- `button` - The button element that triggers the visibility of the listbox.
- `selected-value` - The element that displays the value of the currently selected option (optional). Note that this part does not necessarily have to be places inside the `<button>` part (read on for more information about how to slot your own markup).
- `marker` - Something that indicates this button opens a listbox, e.g. an icon.
- `listbox` - The wrapper that contains the `<option>`(s) and `<optgroup>`(s).
does this exist? - `<optgroup>` - Groups `<option>`(s) together with a label (optional).
- `<option>` - Can have one or more and represents the potential values that can be chosen by the user.

## Default behavior

The default behavior of the `<selectmenu>` control mimics the behavior of the `<select>` control. You can use it just like a native `<select>`, with the following minimal markup:

```html
<selectmenu>
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

When doing so, the default button, select-value, and listbox are created for you.

## Styling parts of the control

One way to style the control to match your requirements is to use the CSS `::part()` pseudo-element to select the different parts within the control's anatomy that you wish to style.

```html
<style>
  .my-select-menu::part(button) {
    color: white;
    background-color: #f00;
    padding: 5px;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }

  .my-select-menu::part(listbox) {
    padding: 10px;
    margin-top: 5px;
    border: 1px solid red;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
</style>
<selectmenu class="my-select-menu">
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

The above example results in the following style:

<Image
  src="selectmenu-styling-parts.png"
  alt="The rendering of a selectmenu control with the above HTML and CSS code"
/>

`::part()` can be used to style the `button`, `selected-value`, and `listbox` parts of the control.

## Use your own markup

You can further customize the control to fit your needs by providing your own markup to replace the default one, and extend and re-order the parts.

### Slotting your own content

A `<selectmenu>` has named [slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#adding_flexibility_with_slots)
that can be referenced to replace the default parts.

For example, to replace the default button with your own, you can do the following:

```html
<style>
  .my-custom-select [slot='button'] {
    display: flex;
    align-content: center;
  }
  .my-custom-select button {
    padding: 5px;
    border: none;
    background: #f06;
    border-radius: 5px 0 0 5px;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .my-custom-select .label {
    padding: 5px;
    border: 1px solid #f06;
    border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;
  }
</style>
<selectmenu class="my-custom-select">
  <div slot="button">
    <button behavior="button">Open</button>
    <span class="label">Choose an option</span>
  </div>
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

The `slot="button"` attribute on the outer `<div>` tells the `<selectmenu>` to replace its default button with the contents of that `<div>`.

The `behavior="button"` attribute on the inner `<button>` tells the browser that this element is what we want to use as the new button. The browser will automatically apply all the click and keyboard handling behavior to this element as well as the appropriate accessibility semantics.

The above code snippet results in the following style:

<Image
  src="selectmenu-replacing-button-part.png"
  alt="The rendering of a selectmenu control with the above HTML and CSS code"
/>

Note that the `slot` and `behavior` attributes can be used on the same element too.

You can replace the default listbox part in a similar fashion:

```html
<style>
  .my-custom-select [popup] {
    width: 300px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));
    gap: 10px;
    padding: 10px;
    box-shadow: none;
    margin: 10px 0;
    border: 1px solid;
    background: #f7f7f7;
  }
</style>
<selectmenu class="my-custom-select">
  <div slot="listbox">
    <div popup behavior="listbox">
      <option>Option 1</option>
      <option>Option 2</option>
      <option>Option 3</option>
      <option>Option 4</option>
      <option>Option 5</option>
    </div>
  </div>
</selectmenu>
```

The `popup` attribute used in this example's `<div popup>` is from the proposal at [Popup API (Explainer)](https://open-ui.org/components/popup.research.explainer). The element with `behavior="listbox"` is required to be a `<div popup=popup>`. Applying `behavior="listbox"` tells the browser to apply select menu listbox behavior to that element: it will be opened when the `<selectmenu>`'s button is clicked, and the user can select `<option>`s inside it with mouse, arrow keys, and touch.

The above code snippet results in the following style:

<Image
  src="selectmenu-replacing-listbox-part.png"
  alt="The rendering of a selectmenu control with the above HTML and CSS code"
/>

### Extending the markup

Not only can you replace the default parts with your own, you can also extend the control's markup by adding new elements. This can be useful to augment the listbox or button with extra information, or to add new functionality.

Consider the following example:

```html
<style>
  .my-custom-select [slot='button'] {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
  .my-custom-select button {
    border: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    width: 2rem;
    height: 2rem;
    border-radius: 50%;
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
  }
  .my-custom-select button::before {
    content: '\25BC';
  }
  .my-custom-select [popup] {
    padding: 0;
  }
  .my-custom-select .section {
    padding: 1rem 0 0;
    background: radial-gradient(ellipse 60% 50px at center top, #000a 0%, transparent 130%);
  }
  .my-custom-select h3 {
    margin: 0 0 1rem 0;
    text-align: center;
    color: white;
  }
  .my-custom-select option {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0.5rem;
  }
</style>
<selectmenu class="my-custom-select">
  <div slot="button">
    <span class="label">Choose a plant</span>
    <span behavior="selected-value" slot="selected-value"></span>
    <button behavior="button"></button>
  </div>
  <div slot="listbox">
    <div popup behavior="listbox">
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Flowers</h3>
        <option>Rose</option>
        <option>Lily</option>
        <option>Orchid</option>
        <option>Tulip</option>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Trees</h3>
        <option>Weeping willow</option>
        <option>Dragon tree</option>
        <option>Giant sequoia</option>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</selectmenu>
```

Using custom markup to wrap the list of options, the above example creates sections with their own styles and content as seen below:

<Image
  src="selectmenu-using-custom-markup.png"
  alt="The rendering of a selectmenu control with the above HTML and CSS code"
/>
